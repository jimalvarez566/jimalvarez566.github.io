### CPSC 120


* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a personal favorite of mine becuase it was one of the first 
    labs which outputted a visual on the terminal. By using one outer for loop and
    one inner for loop, we were able to achieve the image of lines and astericks. 


* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was another favorite of mine because it was a more advanced version
    of the HiLo game we did in previous labs. This game consisted of using if and else
    if statements to estimate whether the user's input was matched the secret number. 


* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was my third favorite lab because it outputted the population of
    counties in California. We achieved this by using 2D vectors to organize the data
    into a table like object. This lab also incorporated multiple things we learned such
    as for loops and if statements.
